              software, and React to create an interactive web interface that our team can use to communicate and set
              schedules for the IoT devices (called ANE32THS) such as live interactive graphs and setting sensor data
              collecting schedules. I had the boards printed, and hand assembled the devices before putting them in

            <p class="card-text">Developed a Python Web Scraper to scrape dynamic JavaScript table data from a publicly
              available website. Me and a community that I am in enjoy collecting, and investing in sealed and graded
              video games. I particularly love video games, and the numismatist in me loves the cleanest, nicest,
              earliest, and rarest example of things. However, for some video game consoles, it's not particularly clear
              what the true population, and therefore rarity, exists out there of these games, and how many <i>mint</i>
              games there are in the population. So I developed a scraper, that then formatted these tables into CSV's
              which were able to be properly read and interpreted by BI tools such as Power BI, and through that I made
              visualizations of the results, and we were able to see the true rarity and hence move forward with more
              accurate evaluation Risk-to-Reward ratio of a great number of new investment areas moving forward.</p>

                were to be prioritized by checking training and validation accuracy. The Naive Bayes MAP implementation
                gave us an 81% validation accuracy, and through some testing of our own input examples, were satisfied
                with the testing accuracy of the model.</p>
