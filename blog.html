                    <div class="mb-4 text-muted">Tuesday: August 27th, 2024</div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">If you go online today, look up Luxury Watches on eCommerce
                        Platforms like eBay, you may find the prices being higher than if you were to buy them from
                        brick & mortar. Which is quite strange, as it is usually the opposite when it comes to shopping
                        online in 2024.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">New watches having a 10-20% margin on Large Marketplaces like
                        eBay is unsustainable. They have to set their prices way above market value to make a profit
                        with 15% fees and keep a substantial margin for themselves. Online Marketplaces are actually
                        less desirable than traditional brick and mortar stores or to have the businesses build,
                        operate, and maintain their own websites and online customer funneling and logistics themselves.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text  mb-4 fs-6">This is why buying watches online is just not going to be very
                        valuable for those seeking to buy it, as they see prices way above market value, so the sellers
                        working off of these tight margins, either due to brand restrictions, high wholesale costs, or
                        the just the cost of high end watches in general making profit margins tighter. So having the
                        stress from a 15% service fee like eBay or Amazon does not make sense, and on top of that, being
                        at risk for losing that item and the prevalence of fraud on platforms like eBay makes using
                        these platforms just not feasible.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">If a platform like Telaport, who’s trading fee is only $2 as of
                        this writing, can lower the service fee to as close to base transaction fee for cash payments as
                        possible, that would be an immense relief on the business and more importantly the customers
                        wanting better priced inventory. Not only that, having the option of using Telaport’s middle-man
                        service on high-end luxury goods in an E-Commerce Marketplace is unheard of before, and adds
                        another layer of confidence with sellers in a Marketplace like Telaport.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">Currently Stripe Fees are 2.9%, and if Telaport charges only 4%
                        for cash transactions, that would be the best value that has ever been offered by any eCommerce
                        Marketplace if you consider all factors such as Price, Marketplace, P2P Service, Middle-Man
                        Service, and more included in that, which the other platforms don’t even offer as an option with
                        their high 15% service fees.</p>

                    <div class="mb-4 text-muted">Tuesday: August 15th, 2024</div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">If you look at what drives the sales of goods and
                        services for non-essentials online or daily use items online, collectables, the root of this is
                        community.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">In Community you can see that groups form, ideas, standards,
                        collectors, communities, promoting what’s popular, what to buy, what not buy. These groups and
                        communities have grown exponentially more powerful as the online world evolved. Starting from
                        Forums then to Social Media Platforms like Facebook, Reddit, and Discord, these communities and
                        groups are almost entirely what drive the market today.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text  mb-4 fs-6">If we look at another major factor which drives these markets, it’s
                        the marketplace. The online Bazaar of sorts, those platforms like eBay, Mercari, and now
                        Telaport. Online Marketplaces give communities, buyers, collectors, business, one giant virtual
                        store to all sell together on. This gives everyone cohesive and up to date sales data, high
                        likelihood access to exactly what they’re looking for, a place to research value before selling,
                        and a place to set up your entire store, which would once be in the middle of nowhere, with no
                        customer traffic, to having the entire nation, the entire world, able to view and purchase your
                        products from you.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">This is fantastic in the sense that it opened up those
                        possibilities, and have made so many loyal customers and businesses who rely on these platforms
                        as the whole arbiter of their sales force. However with this power, businesses have now had to
                        rely on these large tech corporations, and with that came sloth and abuse of power from these
                        now giants of
                        the eCommerce Marketplace industry. They use their power and standing to force high prices and
                        cuts on the everyday businesses. Taking anywhere from 15-20 percent of every sale. However as
                        time went on, their services did not improve, they declined, and have in recent times spiraled
                        out of control, to the point where using them is dangerous for your business and personal items.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">Coming out of the Corona Virus era of government stimulus, poor
                        government decisions, and now the recession/depression we are in, businesses are struggling.
                        During the Corona Virus, when people received extra stimulus, they spent it on things that they
                        wanted, and during that time, businesses that sold low-mid range priced non-necessity items
                        flourished. Showing that people do in fact want these items, if they have the means to purchase
                        them. However today, these same low to middle class people are struggling to afford to eat, find
                        jobs, and have to focus on pure survival from starvation and total loss of their livelihoods.
                        The same goes for these businesses who relied so heavily on eCommerce Marketplaces to support
                        them. However, if you don’t serve high end items to high end clients, in 2024 and beyond, you
                        will not be able to make ends meet.</p>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">These platforms such as eBay and Mercari have been building a
                        horrible reputation among small businesses who rely on honest and consistent business. With eBay
                        promoting buyer fraud, giving zero rights to sellers, and putting them at risk of double
                        negative loss (loss of product + loss of cash) they are in a position to find someone who cares.
                        Mercari has hurt their businesses as well by implementing surprise fees presented to a buyer at
                        checkout, making businesses sales drop off to near zero on that platform. So that’s where
                        somebody, who really isn’t in this space, is winning with their massive marketing campaign,
                        putting hundreds of millions of dollars into marketing, Shopify.</p>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">The internet started out as place where everyone had their own
                        site, sold things on their own platform, however just like in the real world, this was siloed in
                        it’s own sense without it’s own proper marketing budgets and advertising online to get customers
                        to find out they exist. That’s where platforms and marketplaces like eBay came in to save the
                        day and provide this Marketplace where everyone can find their products through simple queries,
                        and it didn’t matter about where the store or business came from. However Shopify is having an
                        extreme amount of success with local and small businesses, as they are the only option. eBay’s
                        high fees mixed with almost non-existent seller protection have pushed people to regress
                        backwards in time, and go back to building their own websites, handling their own shipping
                        logistics, listings, advertisements, and customer funnels themselves. This is all because of the
                        high fees, 15-20 percent, and dangers of using eBay and Mercari. It’s just not worth it, and
                        nobody has stepped up to the plate to fix or solve the problem. That is until today.</p>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">This is where Telaport comes in, the eCommerce Marketplace that
                        gives people the option of complete and total safety through a middle-man logistics network,
                        user-verification, and no percentage based fees, as well as the option of being able to exchange
                        goods for goods, B2B, B2C, C2C, etc… and up to 40lbs of anything, so long as it’s legal and not
                        against Telaport’s ToS. Telaport wants to provide people with not only the eCommerce Marketplace
                        like eBay, but also a Logistics Network like Amazon, and a Community with groups, comments, and
                        communication like Facebook. </p>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">With this, Telaport becomes an all-in-one ecosystem for
                        eCommerce where we solve all of the customer and business needs, and more importantly, don’t
                        abuse our position, and provide this service at the lowest cost possible. Currently the fee
                        ranges from $1-$3 max per trade, regardless of the size. When selling on Telaport, who utilizes
                        Stripe, they will get cost to as close to the Stripe fee as possible to make sure that we
                        encourage commerce, business, trade, buying & selling, so that when you meet someone, talk to a
                        group, you can buy, sell, trade and exchange on the platform, and have the whole process
                        door-door finished through Telaport.</p>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">This total eco-system is what Telaport wants to provide, it’s to
                        focus on community, and the growth of businesses and enabling collectors from every background,

                        the widest array of possible ways to participate in commerce, and have all of those tools to do

                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">Today we are on the verge, of a dawn, to a new era. Today we are
                        at the point which we stood with classical computers in the 1950's. We have working examples of
                        the technology, we are able to perform some of it's most basic functions, however we have yet to
                        fully realize it's capabilities in application in a field outside of academic research.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">It was only this February that Intel released their first <a
                            href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-releases-quantum-sdk.html#gs.38rq2p">Quantum
                            SDK</a> to the public. This SDK is interfacable with C, C++, and Python. It is still low
                        level down to hardware, and mostly directed toward research purposes, as we can tell for <a
                            href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/quantum-computing-chip-to-advance-research.html#gs.38rv2l">Intel's
                            new chip</a> they are going to release, targeted at academia and research facilities.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text  mb-4 fs-6">Clearly we are quite a ways away, I would like to make an estimate
                        of 5-10 years, before we start seeing Quantum Technology being focused in the industry. With
                        business' everywhere now <a

                            on AI</a> we can expect much more public resources dedicated to that field rather than
                        Quantum Computing. However, this gives us time, like the pioneers of computers, to set up the
                        foundations of Quantum Computing and build standards and practices just as our Classic Computing
                        forefathers have done before us. Minor innovations right now, will have major impacts on the
                        field, and will set your name in the history books of Quantum Computing and what will eventually
                        be the focus of our future endeavours.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">Just as everything else in the past, this technology will move
                        faster than the majority of the populace expect it will. Google has just achieved a major
                        milestone in Quantum Computing finally achieving the first actual display of <a

                            Supremacy</a> and performing a computation in 6.18 seconds that would have taken the world's
                        best super computer 47.2 years to compute. Those outside of the loop, just like all other tech
                        booms, will be in for a shock when Quantum Computing matures and begins to apply to real-world
                        solutions just as Machine Learning and "AI" has in the past 5 years.</p>

                    <div class="mb-4 text-muted">Friday: June 16th, 2023</div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">Bill Gate's recently mentioned that the first company or
                        start-up to successfully implement the all-in-one virtual assistant will be the winner of the
                        next era of technology. The field is so fresh with relatively low barriers to entry, Gates gave
                        it a 50-50 chance on whether it will be a corporation or a start-up who will do it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">However, this has not stopped Microsoft from making the push
                        themselves. Recently they announced Co-Pilot, an assistant powered by the same model as Chat-GPT
                        to allow users to ask for help, but this time it is integrated within Microsoft applications
                        such as Excel, Word, Outlook, Bing, etc..., where the assistant can not only give you answers,
                        but use your files and information and write all the formulas and outputs you need by simple
                        text prompts.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text  mb-4 fs-6">Microsoft's stocks have shot the company to a record evaluation of
                        2.6 Trillion dollars. However Microsoft isn't the only company who will benefit from the boost
                        in it's early stages. All companies who adopt rather than reject Chat-GPT and it's similar kin,
                        will be far ahead of their competitors. Think about the Software Engineer who is trying to
                        troubleshoot a problem that can take anywhere from one day to a whole week, delaying projects
                        and timelines. Now imagine, each of your SE's are equipped with a tool such as Chat-GPT, they
                        are able to take those problems unique to your business, and utulize Microsoft's massive ML
                        model trained on their datasets of coding problems, to come up with a reasonable solution, or at
                        the very least get your SE's in the right direction to resolving problems and reducing
                        troubleshooting times, and over-all pushing major complicated projects out the door faster than
                        all of their competitors who are uneccesarily not using such powerful tools.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">In-Fact, Chat-GPT just showed me a simple mistake I was making
                        when formatting this blog. Pointing out that instead of using a break, mb-auto should have been
                        set to a number such as mb-4. Saving me 10-20 minutes of searching the web myself and looking at
                        others peoples conversations to extract what's useful to me. In-fact, it noticed that my already
                        implemented code could've been improved, rather than just giving me a general solution. Let that
                        sink-in, and you tell me who's company is going to be better off in the next 5 years. Those who
                        utulize the latest productivity tools, or those who don't? </p>
