                    <div class="mb-4 text-muted">Monday: July 17th, 2023</div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">Today we are on the verge, of a dawn, to a new era. Today we are at the point which we stood with classical computers in the 1950's. We have working examples of the technology, we are able to perform some of it's most basic functions, however we have yet to fully realize it's capabilities in application in a field outside of academic research.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">It was only this February that Intel released their first <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-releases-quantum-sdk.html#gs.38rq2p">Quantum SDK</a> to the public. This SDK is interfacable with C, C++, and Python. It is still low level down to hardware, and mostly directed toward research purposes, as we can tell for <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/quantum-computing-chip-to-advance-research.html#gs.38rv2l">Intel's new chip</a> they are going to release, targeted at academia and research facilities.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text  mb-4 fs-6">Clearly we are quite a ways away, I would like to make an estimate of 5-10 years, before we start seeing Quantum Technology being focused in the industry. With business' everywhere now <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/chatgpt-was-an-oh-crap-moment-for-hundreds-of-ceos-its-sparked-a-desperate-response-/articleshow/101661904.cms">focused on AI</a> we can expect much more public resources dedicated to that field rather than Quantum Computing. However, this gives us time, like the pioneers of computers, to set up the foundations of Quantum Computing and build standards and practices just as our Classic Computing forefathers have done before us. Minor innovations right now, will have major impacts on the field, and will set your name in the history books of Quantum Computing and what will eventually be the focus of our future endeavours.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">Just as everything else in the past, this technology will move faster than the majority of the populace expect it will. Google has just achieved a major milestone in Quantum Computing finally achieving the first actual display of <a href="https://www.earth.com/news/quantum-computer-can-instantly-execute-a-task-that-would-normally-take-47-years/">Quantum Supremacy</a> and performing a computation in 6.18 seconds that would have taken the world's best super computer 47.2 years to compute. Those outside of the loop, just like all other tech booms, will be in for a shock when Quantum Computing matures and begins to apply to real-world solutions just as Machine Learning and "AI" has in the past 5 years.</p>

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Chat-GPT and Successful Business'</h3>
                    <div class="mb-4 text-muted">Friday: June 16th, 2023</div>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">Bill Gate's recently mentioned that the first company or start-up to successfully implement the all-in-one virtual assistant will be the winner of the next era of technology. The field is so fresh with relatively low barriers to entry, Gates gave it a 50-50 chance on whether it will be a corporation or a start-up who will do it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">However, this has not stopped Microsoft from making the push themselves. Recently they announced Co-Pilot, an assistant powered by the same model as Chat-GPT to allow users to ask for help, but this time it is integrated within Microsoft applications such as Excel, Word, Outlook, Bing, etc..., where the assistant can not only give you answers, but use your files and information and write all the formulas and outputs you need by simple text prompts.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text  mb-4 fs-6">Microsoft's stocks have shot the company to a record evaluation of 2.6 Trillion dollars. However Microsoft isn't the only company who will benefit from the boost in it's early stages. All companies who adopt rather than reject Chat-GPT and it's similar kin, will be far ahead of their competitors. Think about the Software Engineer who is trying to troubleshoot a problem that can take anywhere from one day to a whole week, delaying projects and timelines. Now imagine, each of your SE's are equipped with a tool such as Chat-GPT, they are able to take those problems unique to your business, and utulize Microsoft's massive ML model trained on their datasets of coding problems, to come up with a reasonable solution, or at the very least get your SE's in the right direction to resolving problems and reducing troubleshooting times, and over-all pushing major complicated projects out the door faster than all of their competitors who are uneccesarily not using such powerful tools.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text ml-4 mb-4 fs-6">In-Fact, Chat-GPT just showed me a simple mistake I was making when formatting this blog. Pointing out that instead of using a break, mb-auto should have been set to a number such as mb-4. Saving me 10-20 minutes of searching the web myself and looking at others peoples conversations to extract what's useful to me. In-fact, it noticed that my already implemented code could've been improved, rather than just giving me a general solution. Let that sink-in, and you tell me who's company is going to be better off in the next 5 years. Those who utulize the latest productivity tools, or those who don't? </p>
