                    <p class="card-text mb-auto fs-6">Computer's have been my passion my entire life. The computer is an extension of man's mind, and allows man, for the first time ever, put thought into the physical world.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text mb-auto fs-6">I began to take programming/computer science seriously in 2011 when I purchased my first text book to give me the foundations of everything I needed to learn about programming.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text mb-auto fs-6">By 2013, I had consumed so many textbooks, that I went from learning BASIC to publishing Android APK's on the Googe Play Store in October 2013.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text mb-auto fs-6">Also in October 2013, I had been chosen to begin an un-paid internship at my local Television Studio TV Cogeco (now Your TV), and began directing live tv shows extremely quickly as my talent in conducting team efforts and attention to detail was very much welcome in the television industry. I stayed with the television studio until my High-School graduation in 2017.</p>

                    <p class="card-text mb-auto fs-6">After Graduating High-School with Honours and an academic average of 96% (particularly excelling in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Physics, and Communications Technologies), I began my career at the University of Toronto in August 2017.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text mb-auto fs-6">Initially I had enrolled in the Computer Scientist Specialist program, I had a much difficult time taking and studying for my Math classes, in retrospect it was mostly due to something I would not learn of until recently. I then had to shift my focus, but still adiment on achieving my goal of a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, I began <span class="badge text-bg-warning">Computer Science</span> & <span class="badge text-bg-success">Geographical Information Systems</span> Minors, with a <span class="badge text-bg-primary">Communications, Culture, and Information Technologies</span> Major.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text mb-auto fs-6">I found out something about myself that shocked even me. At first, I had thought that I would not enjoy anything to do with Statistics, having taken a Post-Graduate Level Statistics course in my second year as a Computer Science Specialist requirement. However, I quickly found out that in GIS, with my Computer Science background, I was able to use statistics to my advantage. I quickly was able to produce and interpret results in all of my Geographical Information Systems (Sattelite & Data Processing) courses allowing me to quickly become top of my class in all applied GIS courses, creating the best team projects in my class.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="card-text mb-auto fs-6">Now today, after waiting out the pandemic, I am finishing my degree (B. Sc.) in December 2022, and will have a great range of new skills from Computer Science, to Advanced Statistics, to GIS, to Web-Design, to Game-Design, and some Computer Engineering feats all under my belt. My current projects are ever-more exciting, and applicable to the real-world, and I look forward to sharing them with you on this website.</p>
